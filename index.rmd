::: {#description .sec}
This course is designed as an *in-person* course aimed at introducing the basic theory, the fundamental algorithms, and the computational toolboxes of machine learning. The focus is on a balanced treatment of the practical and theoretical approaches, along with hands on experience with relevant software packages. Supervised learning methods covered in the course will include: the study of linear models for classification and regression, neural networks. Unsupervised learning methods covered in the course will include: k-means clustering, and Gaussian mixture models. Techniques to control overfitting, including regularization and validation, will be covered. Furthermore, this course introduces the fundamental of Markov Decision Process and Reinforcement Learning.

For your convenience, all lectures and instructor's Office Hours will be also live-streamed over [Zoom](`r zoom_lec_l`). Furthermore, all lectures will be recorded and posted on the course website. Note that tutorials won't be recorded and live-streamed.

##  Submitting Coursework
- Do not submit your coursework via email.
- If anything goes wrong, please ask a question in Piazza or contact a course 
assistant.
- You can submit as many times as you'd like until the deadline. We will only 
grade the last submission.
- Partial work is better than not submitting any work.
:::

::: {#latedays .sec}
## Late Days
5% deduction will be applied per day of lateness. No Submissions will be 
accepted after 72 hours except for documented unusual circumstances

::: {#sylremark .sec}
## Regrade Requests

Regrade requests are due within 1 week of receiving the graded work and must be 
submitted by posting a private questions on Piazza.

  - We ask that you carefully review your assignments, reflect, and write a 
  short explanation justifying the reasons for a regrading request.
  - If a grade is contested and we realize that the marker made a mistake in the
  student's favour, the mark for that assignment may be lowered when the mistake
  is found. This would otherwise create a situation which is unfair to other
  students.
  - Please include your full name and UTORid in the body of the private note.
