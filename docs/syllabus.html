</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>See the course schedule for the tentative due dates. Note that
<strong>due dates may change</strong> based on how the course is
progressing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="latedays" class="container sec">
<div id="lateness-policy" class="section level2">
<h2>Lateness Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li>5% deduction will be applied per day of lateness. No Submissions
will be accepted after 72 hours except for documented unusual
circumstances</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="sylmissterm" class="container sec">
<div id="missed-term-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Missed Term Work</h2>
<p>In general, if work is missed due to an emergency situation, then the
weight of the work will be placed on other similar components in the
course. For example, a missed term test would add to the weight of the
final exam, and a missed assignment would add to the weight of a later
assignment. Exact accommodation will be discussed between the student
and the instructor, who must be informed within 72 hours of the due
date.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="sylremark" class="container sec">
<div id="remark-requests" class="section level2">
<h2>Remark Requests</h2>
<p>Remark requests are due within 1 week of receiving the graded work
and must be submitted by posting a private note on Piazza.</p>
<ul>
<li>We ask that you carefully review your assignments, reflect, and
write a short explanation justifying the reasons for a regrading
request.</li>
<li>If a grade is contested and we realize that the marker made a
mistake in the student’s favour, the mark for that assignment may be
lowered when the mistake is found. This would otherwise create a
situation which is unfair to other students.</li>
<li>Please include your full name and UTORid in the body of the private
note.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="syltut" class="container sec">
<div id="tutorials" class="section level2">
<h2>Tutorials</h2>
<p>Tutorials consist of reviews and exercises that will prepare you for
the tests as well as the assignments. They are a crucial learning
component of this course and are as important to attend as the
lectures!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="sylannounce" class="container sec">
<div id="course-announcements" class="section level2">
<h2>Course Announcements</h2>
<p>You are responsible for reading all postings made by the instructor
or the TAs on the course webpage, Quercus, and Piazza, and for being
familiar with the entire content of this Syllabus; please take a few
minutes at the beginning of the term to read through the entire
Syllabus.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="syldisc" class="container sec">
<div id="discussion-board" class="section level2">
<h2>Discussion Board</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>For all questions of general interest (whose answers are likely
to be useful to other students, e.g., about the course material, problem
sets, programming assignments, Wireshark labs, general questions about
course logistics and administration), where you can ask the question
while respecting the academic integrity of the course (without revealing
any idea or part of a solution to a course assessment), please start a
new topic directly on the Piazza discussion forum, so that everyone can
benefit from reading your questions and the associated answers. We will
monitor the forum regularly, but feel free to answer questions from
other students, too! Helping someone else learn is one of the most
effective ways to master a subject.</p></li>
<li><p>For personal questions (making appointments, remarking requests,
extensions, missing class, etc.), please email the course instructor
directly from your University of Toronto email address. Please include
“ECE421” in the subject line and your full name and UTORid in the body
of the email. Otherwise, your message might be marked as spam! We aim to
respond to all email and forum postings by the end of the next business
day (not counting weekends and holidays). However, it may take longer,
especially near due dates. If you do not hear back after four days,
please do not hesitate to send a follow-up email or come in person
during office hours.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="sylcommunication" class="container sec">
<div id="communications" class="section level2">
<h2>Communications</h2>
<p>It is the student’s responsibility to: - Maintain current contact
information with the University, including address, phone numbers, and
emergency contact information. - Use the university-provided e-mail
address or maintain a valid forwarding e-mail address. - Regularly check
the official University communications channels. Official University
communications are considered received if sent by postal mail, fax, or
e-mail to the student’s designated primary e-mail account via their
<span class="citation">@utoronto.ca</span> alias. - Accept that
forwarded e-mails may be lost and that e-mail is considered received if
sent via the student’s <span class="citation">@utoronto.ca</span> alias.
- Check the UofT/Quercus email and course websites on a regular basis
during the term. Further, check the discussion board daily for any
course updates/announcements. - Read and keep current with the
discussions on the discussion board.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="sylintegrity" class="container sec">
<div id="academic-integrity" class="section level2">
<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>All students, faculty and staff are expected to follow the
University’s guidelines and policies on academic integrity. For
students, this means following the standards of academic honesty when
writing assignments, collaborating with fellow students, and writing
tests and exams. Ensure that the work you submit for grading represents
your own honest efforts.</p>
<p>Plagiarism, representing someone else’s work as your own or
submitting work that you have previously submitted for marks in another
class or program, is a serious offence that can result in sanctions.
Speak to me or your TA for advice on anything that you find unclear. To

<h2>Indigenous Students’ Supports</h2>
<p>If you are an Indigenous engineering student, you are invited to join
a private Discord channel to meet other Indigenous students, professors,
and staff, chat about scholarships, awards, work opportunities,
Indigenous-related events, and receive mentorship. Email Professor

<div id="accommodations" class="section level2">
<h2>Accommodations</h2>
<p>The University of Toronto supports accommodations for students with
diverse learning needs, which may be associated with mental health
conditions, learning disabilities, autism spectrum, ADHD, mobility
impairments, functional/fine motor impairments, concussion or head
injury, visual impairments, chronic health conditions, addictions,
D/deaf, deafened or hard of hearing, communication disorders and/or
temporary disabilities, such as fractures and severe sprains, or
recovery from an operation.</p>
<p>If you have a learning need requiring an accommodation the University
of Toronto recommends that students <a
href="https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/service/accessibility-services-registration-and-documentation-requirements/">register
with Accessibility Services</a> as soon as possible.</p>
<p>We know that many students may be hesitant to reach out to
Accessibility Services for accommodations. The process of accommodation
is private; we will not share details of your needs or condition with
any instructor.</p>
<p>If you feel hesitant to register with us, we encourage you to reach
out for further information and resources on how we can support. It may
feel difficult to ask for help, but it can make all the difference
during your time here.</p>

<div id="special-consideration" class="section level2">
<h2>Special Consideration</h2>
<p>Please contact us immediately if you cannot complete coursework or
miss a test due to a major illness or other circumstances outside your
control. Special consideration will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis
and is not given automatically. We may be unable to grant you exactly
the special consideration you seek, so please ensure we have time to
discuss your situation.</p>
<p>In order to receive special consideration, you must fill out a
Request for Special Consideration Form. Submit the form in PDF format as
soon as possible, together with any supporting documentation, to the
course instructor’s email address.</p>
<p>You can contact us (by email using the course instructor’s email
address) even before you have your documentation ready to submit; we
won’t be able to tell you at that point what accommodation you may
receive, but we can answer other questions and offer advice. It is
always easier to resolve situations earlier rather than later. If you
face a particularly disruptive situation that is likely to impact more
than one course, please contact your College Registrar. They are best
equipped to provide you with general advice and support that goes beyond
a single course.</p>

<p><strong>Looking for community? Feeling isolated? Not being understood
or heard?</strong></p>
<p><strong>You are not alone.</strong> You can talk to anyone in the
Faculty that you feel comfortable approaching, anytime – professors,
instructors, teaching assistants, <a
href="https://undergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca/contact/#_blank">first-year</a>
or <a
href="https://undergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca/contact/#_blank">upper
years</a> academic advisors, student leaders or the <a
href="marisa.sterling@utoronto.ca">Assistant Dean of Diversity,
Inclusion and Professionalism</a>.</p>
<p><strong>You belong here.</strong> In this class, the participation
and perspectives of everyone is invited and encouraged. The broad range
of identities and the intersections of those identities are valued and
create an inclusive team environment that will help you achieve academic
success. You can read the evidence for this approach <a
href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2019/04/business-case-for-diversity-in-the-workplace/">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>You have rights.</strong> The <a
href="https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/secretariat/policies/code-student-conduct-december-13-2019">University
Code of Student Conduct</a> and the <a
href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/students-handouts/fact-sheet-1-ontario-human-rights-code">Ontario
Human Rights Code</a> protect you against all forms of harassment or
discrimination, including but not limited to acts of racism, sexism,
Islamophobia, antisemitism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, classism
and ageism. Engineering denounces unprofessionalism or intolerance in
language, actions or interactions, in person or online, on- or
off-campus. Engineering takes these concerns extremely seriously and you
can confidentially disclose directly to the Assistant Dean for help <a
href="marisa.sterling@utoronto.ca">here</a>.</p>

<h2>University Land Acknowledgement</h2>
<p>I wish to acknowledge this land on which the University of Toronto
operates. For thousands of years, it has been the traditional land of
the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and the Mississaugas of the Credit. Today,
this meeting place is still the home to many Indigenous people from
across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work
on this land. Learn more about Canada’s relationship with Indigenous
Peoples <a
